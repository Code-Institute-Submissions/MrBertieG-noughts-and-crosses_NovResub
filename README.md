# Introduction

Welcome to the famous game of Noughts and Crosses aka Tic Tac Toe for US users.
This game is played between a player (HUMAN) and the computer (BOT). 
This game is played by entering X and O in one of the nine positions.  There are three possible outcomes for the user. Win, Loose or Tie.

To win, 3 of the same symbols have to be in the same row, or column or diagonal.
The start, the "who goes first" function determines randomly who starts the game first.

As you might know, the easiest way to win at the game is to capture the corners, hence why the BOT was programmed to check for the corners first if available then the center of the outer edges.

The BOT will try and block any potential wins for the player.

If the board gets filled and no one wins, the programm will return TIE.

The player can quit at any time if they imput 'Q'.

The board's spaces are labeled 1 to 9 starting with 1 at the top left and 9 bottom right corner.
